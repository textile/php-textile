h1. Overview

Textile consists of two components: a lightweight markup language, and a
 processor for converting that language into XHTML.

Textile, the language, is a simple shorthand for marking up the most common
 XHTML elements and entities. It is designed to be easy to edit and read in
 plain text, while offering a versatile feature set.

Textile, the processor, has been ported from the original PHP version to
 several other programming languages. This is the PHP version of Textile.
