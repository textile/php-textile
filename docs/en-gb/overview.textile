h1. Overview

Textile is a web text generator. It consists of two components:

; the Textile langauge
: a lightweight markup language
; the Textile processor
: a way to convert that language into XHTML

Textile, the language, is a simple shorthand for marking up the most common
 web text elements and special characters. It is designed to be easy to edit
 and read in plain text, while offering a versatile feature set.

Textile, the processor, has been ported from the original PHP version to
 several other programming languages. This is the PHP version of Textile.
