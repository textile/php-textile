h1. TEXTILE

p=. *A Humane Web Text Generator*

p=. A lightweight markup language that takes (almost) plaintext and converts it into well formed HTML.



h2. Installation

The only file that is necessary for the correct operation of Textile is @classTextile.php@ from the project root directory. However, to use additional features you may need to install other files from the project tree.

For live installations only files and subdirectories from the @master@ branch should be used. _Code from other branches should not be used on live sites._

See the "composer wiki page":https://github.com/netcarver/textile/wiki/Installation-via-Composer if you use "composer":https://getcomposer.org to manage the dependencies in your projects. 


h2. General Usage

You'll need to include the source file and instantiate a parser...

bc.. include "classTextile.php"; # adjust paths if needed.
$textile = new Textile();

p. Then, for input that you control, pass it to @TextileThis()@. Like so...

bc. $output = $textile->TextileThis( $trusted_input );

If you are using Textile to format user-supplied input, blog comments for instance, use a @TextileRestricted()@ call...

bc. $output = $textile->TextileRestricted( $untrusted_input );

h2. CodeIgniter Helper Usage

Copy @classTextile.php@ to @/application/helpers/textile_helper.php@

Then simply use textile as follows:

bc.. $this->load->helper('textile');
$text = Textile("Dude this is *my* code!");



h2. Doctypes

From v2.3.2 onward, PHP Textile can target either XHTML or HTML5 output with XHTML being the default for backward compatibility. If you need HTML5 generation, just do...

bc.. $textile = new Textile('html5');

p. ...and you'll get @abbr@ instead of @acronym@ and if you use alignment markers on your images you'll have extra classes placed on them instead of xhtml's @align@ attribute.
